# Structure Factor

Structure factor is calculated for a given xyz file.

The script reads in input.xyz and inc.paramters.

## input.xyz
N (row) by 3 (col) in which each row corresponds to a single atom/bead and each col x, y, and z.

## inc.parameters
num_atoms: number of total atoms/beads = N
n: number of points in each axis in the reciprocal space
L: simulation box size
